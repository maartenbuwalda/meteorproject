# Meteorproject - Gorilla Warfare
A small meteor project for a meteor workshop. I am creating a simple game, based on our own boardgame called Gorilla Warfare. In this version of the game the goal is to challenge other players, and defeat them by clicking faster on the 'hit' button than they do.

A video about this genius boardgame: [Video](https://vimeo.com/119535149)

## Used packages:
- accounts-password            
- autopublish (only used this because I was wasting too much time on trying something else)         
- fourseven:scss               
- ian:accounts-ui-bootstrap-3  
- iron:router                  
- meteor-platform              
- mizzao:bootstrap-3

## Possible bugs:
When playing with more than 2 players and challenging one another, it is possible that the match will not start at once.
